Project Title: RestaurantQ

Project Description: We have a world restaurant website that presents the user with a home page, menu order page, and a check out page. Each of these web pages are interactive with one another, allowing the user to move from page to page. The home page presents the user with photos of some of the menu meal selections and navigation to the menu and completed order page. The menu page enables the user to select their meal choices along with navigation to the other pages. The order checkout page finalizes the order and amount due. Since anyone in the world can order from the menu, a currency calculator API calculates the cost of the USD menu items to European Euro (EUR), Japanese Yen (JPY), British Pound (GBP), Swiss Franc (CHF), Canadian Dollar (CAD), and South African Rand (ZAR). The currency calculator uses local storage to store the cost and ordered item. The order checkout page also offers a joke that the user can request at the click of a button using the joke API.

As a user I: 
•	Will be presented with a mobile based website for a restaurant that I will be dining at. 
•	Will have the ability to move from the homepage to other functional pages.
•	Will be presented with menu to order from. 
•	Will have the ability to choose which currency I use converted to USD.
•	Will have the ability to see a joke displayed upon the click of a button.
